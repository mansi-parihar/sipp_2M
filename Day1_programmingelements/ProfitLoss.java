//CP - Create a program to calculate the profit and loss in number and percentage based on the cost price
//of INR 129 and the selling price of INR 191.
//Hint =>
//Use a single print statement to display multiline text and variables.
//Profit = selling price - cost price
//Profit Percentage = profit / cost price * 100
//I/P => NONE
//O/P =>
//The Cost Price is INR ___ and the Selling Price is INR ___
//The Profit is INR ___ and the Profit Percentage is ___
