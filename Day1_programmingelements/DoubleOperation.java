//CP - Write a DoubleOperation program by taking a, b, and c as input values and print the results of the
//following operations a + b *c, a * b + c, c + a / b, and a % b + c. Please also understand the Operator
//Precedence.
//Hint =>
//1. Create variables a, b, and c of double data type.
//2. Take user input for a, b, and c.
//3. Compute 3 double operations and assign the result to a variable
//4. Finally, print the result and try to understand operator precedence.
//I/P => fee, discountPrecent
//O/P => The results of Double Operations are ___, ___, and ___
